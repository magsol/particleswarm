Particle Swarm Optimization
===========================

This is the particle swarm optimization (PSO) code I wrote for the Lab 5 assignment as a TA for the Spring 2012 rendition of Cell &amp; Systems Modeling at Carnegie Mellon University.

 - **lab5.py**: This is the file the students had to complete. It contains definitions for but missing implementations of the update methods required for PSO.
 - **answer.py**: Identical to `lab5.py` but with the solutions filled in.
 - **util.py**: Some utility methods to help visualize the algorithm.
 - **mysterious.npy**: The "secret image" that is slowly revealed as the PSO algorithm iterates over its surface.
 - **Lab 5.pdf**: The instructions for the lab.
